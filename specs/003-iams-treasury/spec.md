# Feature Specification: Institutional Asset Management System (IAMS)

**Feature Branch**: `003-iams-treasury`
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Epic 3 from Project Equinox Requirements - Institutional Asset Management System"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Multi-Asset Custody Architecture (Priority: P1)

The Chief Investment Officer requires institutional-grade cryptocurrency custody solutions supporting Bitcoin, Ethereum, and major stablecoins (USDT, USDC) with multi-signature wallet controls and hardware security module (HSM) integration. The architecture implements hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets and undergoes regular third-party security audits.

**Why this priority**: Secure custody is the foundational requirement for managing digital assets. Without robust custody infrastructure, the institution cannot safely hold client assets, making this capability essential before any treasury operations or trading can occur.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating multi-signature wallets for each supported asset class, verifying HSM integration for key management, generating HD wallet hierarchies, executing test transactions across all asset types, and conducting security audits to validate custody controls.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the Treasury Operations team needs to secure Bitcoin holdings, **When** they create a new custody wallet, **Then** the system generates a multi-signature wallet requiring 3-of-5 key authorization with keys distributed across HSMs
2. **Given** the institution holds Ethereum and ERC-20 stablecoins, **When** treasury staff initiate transactions, **Then** the system enforces multi-signature approval workflows with role-based access controls
3. **Given** the custody architecture uses HD wallets, **When** new client accounts are created, **Then** unique derived addresses are generated deterministically without exposing master keys
4. **Given** the security team conducts quarterly audits, **When** third-party auditors review the custody infrastructure, **Then** they verify HSM integration, key management procedures, and multi-signature controls meet institutional standards
5. **Given** a hardware security module fails, **When** backup HSMs are activated, **Then** key material is recovered without loss and custody operations continue without interruption

### User Story 2 - Automated Treasury Management (Priority: P2)

The Treasury Operations Manager needs intelligent automation for treasury operations including consolidated pooling (aggregating assets for operational efficiency), distributed custody (risk mitigation through geographic/technical distribution), and smart rebalancing (algorithmic asset allocation optimization). The system provides transaction forensics, complete audit trails, real-time anomaly detection, and multi-region disaster recovery.

**Why this priority**: While secure custody (P1) enables holding assets, automated treasury management significantly improves operational efficiency and risk management. However, manual treasury operations can function without automation, making this P2.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by configuring pooling rules and verifying automated aggregation, setting up distributed custody across multiple locations, implementing rebalancing algorithms and verifying optimal allocation, testing transaction forensics on sample transaction histories, and simulating disaster scenarios to verify backup recovery.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the institution has assets spread across 100+ wallets, **When** the consolidated pooling process runs, **Then** the system automatically aggregates funds to operational wallets while maintaining minimum security thresholds
2. **Given** the risk management policy requires geographic distribution, **When** the distributed custody system operates, **Then** assets are automatically distributed across multiple regions and technical implementations (cold storage, warm wallets, hot wallets)
3. **Given** portfolio allocations drift from target percentages, **When** the smart rebalancing algorithm executes, **Then** the system calculates optimal trades to restore target allocations while minimizing transaction costs and tax impact
4. **Given** a suspicious transaction pattern is detected, **When** the anomaly detection system alerts operators, **Then** treasury staff receive real-time notifications with transaction forensics showing the suspicious activity chain
5. **Given** a primary data center experiences an outage, **When** disaster recovery activates, **Then** treasury operations fail over to backup regions within the 1-hour RTO requirement with maximum 5-minute data loss (RPO)

### User Story 3 - Strategic Partnership Integration (Priority: P3)

The Chief Compliance Officer requires secure integration with institutional partners like Warp Data LLC for custody services, maintaining segregated client asset tracking, independent transaction verification, participation in institutional staking/yield programs, and complete audit trails for all partner interactions.

**Why this priority**: Partnership integrations enhance capabilities but are not essential for core treasury operations. The institution can function with internal custody and manual verification processes, though external partnerships provide additional benefits.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by configuring API integrations with partner systems, verifying segregated account tracking across multiple clients, implementing independent verification processes that cross-check partner data, and testing staking program participation with sample allocations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the institution partners with Warp Data LLC for custody, **When** assets are transferred to partner custody, **Then** API integration automatically synchronizes balances and maintains segregated tracking per client account
2. **Given** client assets are held in partner custody, **When** transactions occur, **Then** the system performs independent verification by cross-checking partner-reported transactions against blockchain records
3. **Given** the institution participates in institutional staking programs, **When** eligible assets are allocated, **Then** the system tracks staking positions, yield accrual, and reward distributions separately per client
4. **Given** compliance auditors review partner relationships, **When** they examine audit trails, **Then** they see complete transaction histories including API calls, balance reconciliations, and verification results
5. **Given** a partner integration experiences technical issues, **When** API connectivity is lost, **Then** the system alerts operations staff and continues functioning with cached data until connectivity is restored

### User Story 4 - Global Market Access (Priority: P3)

The Trading Operations Manager needs intelligent routing to global cryptocurrency markets with API integration to tier-1 exchanges, smart order routing based on liquidity and pricing, jurisdictional compliance engine, real-time tax lot tracking, and best execution analytics.

**Why this priority**: Market access enables active trading but is not required for passive custody and treasury management. The institution can function with manual trading processes or limited exchange relationships, making this an optimization rather than a foundational requirement.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by configuring exchange API integrations, implementing smart order routing algorithms and testing across different liquidity scenarios, configuring jurisdictional compliance rules per region, tracking tax lots through sample trading sequences, and generating best execution reports from test trades.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the institution has API connections to multiple tier-1 exchanges, **When** a trading order is submitted, **Then** the smart order routing engine analyzes liquidity and pricing across exchanges and automatically routes to the optimal venue
2. **Given** regulatory requirements vary by jurisdiction, **When** a trade is executed, **Then** the jurisdictional compliance engine verifies the trade complies with applicable regulations before execution
3. **Given** the institution must track cost basis for tax reporting, **When** trades are executed, **Then** the system maintains real-time tax lot tracking using configurable methodologies (FIFO, LIFO, HIFO)
4. **Given** the compliance team needs to demonstrate best execution, **When** they review trading history, **Then** analytics reports show execution quality metrics including price improvement, slippage, and venue comparison
5. **Given** an exchange experiences technical issues, **When** the primary trading venue becomes unavailable, **Then** orders are automatically rerouted to alternative exchanges with equivalent liquidity

- How does the system handle blockchain network congestion impacting transaction times?
- What happens when rebalancing algorithms produce trades that would violate minimum balance requirements?
- How does the system handle partner API rate limits or temporary unavailability?
- What happens when exchange API returns conflicting price data?
- How does the system manage blockchain forks (Bitcoin, Ethereum hard forks)?
- What happens when smart contract interactions fail during staking operations?
- How does the system handle situations where best execution conflicts with jurisdictional compliance?
