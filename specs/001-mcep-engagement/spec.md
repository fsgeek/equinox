# Feature Specification: Multi-Channel Client Engagement Platform (MCEP)

**Feature Branch**: `001-mcep-engagement`
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Epic 1 from Project Equinox Requirements - Multi-Channel Client Engagement Platform"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Unified Communication Infrastructure (Priority: P1)

Portfolio Managers need to reach prospective clients across multiple messaging platforms (WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, iMessage) from a centralized management interface. This eliminates the need to switch between different apps and devices while managing outreach campaigns.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational capability for all client engagement activities. Without multi-channel communication infrastructure, Portfolio Managers cannot effectively reach clients on their preferred platforms, resulting in lost opportunities and inefficient workflows.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having a Portfolio Manager send test messages through the centralized dashboard to test accounts on each supported platform (WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, iMessage) and verify delivery and tracking.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Portfolio Manager logs into the MCEP dashboard, **When** they create a new outreach message, **Then** they can select target recipients across multiple messaging platforms from a single interface
2. **Given** a Portfolio Manager has sent messages to clients on different platforms, **When** they view the engagement analytics dashboard, **Then** they see response rates, open rates, and engagement metrics aggregated across all platforms
3. **Given** the system manages 50+ mobile devices, **When** a device becomes unavailable, **Then** messages are automatically routed to alternative devices without manual intervention
4. **Given** a Portfolio Manager reviews campaign performance, **When** they access the analytics dashboard, **Then** they see real-time engagement metrics including delivery confirmation, read receipts, and response patterns

### User Story 2 - Market Segment Personalization (Priority: P2)

Portfolio Managers need to maintain multiple professional profiles tailored to different market segments, asset classes, and regional markets. Each profile includes customized messaging, visual branding, and language localization appropriate for the target audience.

**Why this priority**: While multi-channel infrastructure (P1) enables reaching clients, personalization significantly improves engagement rates. However, basic communication can function without personalization, making this a P2 priority.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by creating 3-5 test profiles for different market segments (e.g., cryptocurrency investors, real estate investors, different regions), configuring their localization and messaging, and verifying that outreach campaigns use the appropriate profile based on recipient segmentation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Portfolio Manager manages clients in different regions, **When** they create a new engagement profile, **Then** they can configure language preferences, cultural messaging guidelines, and regional compliance requirements
2. **Given** a Portfolio Manager has created 50 profiles for different segments, **When** they launch a campaign, **Then** the system automatically selects the appropriate profile based on recipient demographics and asset class interest
3. **Given** a Portfolio Manager wants to optimize engagement, **When** they configure A/B testing parameters, **Then** the system automatically tests different messaging approaches and identifies the highest-performing variations
4. **Given** the compliance team reviews engagement activities, **When** they audit profile configurations, **Then** they can verify that all profiles comply with platform terms of service and regional regulations

### User Story 3 - Intelligent Lead Management (Priority: P3)

Portfolio Managers need automated workflow orchestration to qualify leads, prioritize high-value prospects, and manage initial engagement sequences. The system uses machine learning to score leads based on engagement patterns and seamlessly hands off qualified prospects to human advisors.

**Why this priority**: Automation improves efficiency but requires the foundational infrastructure (P1) and personalization capabilities (P2) to be effective. This represents an optimization of an already-functional system.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by configuring lead scoring rules, running test campaigns with simulated prospect interactions, and verifying that leads are correctly scored, prioritized, and handed off to CRM systems when they meet qualification criteria.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new prospect engages with outreach content, **When** the system analyzes their interaction patterns, **Then** it automatically assigns a lead score based on engagement frequency, response quality, and asset class interest
2. **Given** a lead reaches a qualification threshold, **When** the automated engagement sequence completes, **Then** the system creates a CRM record and notifies the appropriate Portfolio Manager for personal follow-up
3. **Given** the compliance team monitors automated communications, **When** the system sends automated messages, **Then** all communications are logged with complete audit trails and comply with regulatory requirements
4. **Given** Portfolio Managers review campaign effectiveness, **When** they analyze lead conversion metrics, **Then** they see response rate optimization trends showing continuous improvement from machine learning adjustments

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a messaging platform becomes temporarily unavailable (e.g., WhatsApp outage)?
- How does the system handle clients who block or report profiles as spam?
- What happens when a Portfolio Manager reaches the device limit for a specific messaging platform?
- How does the system handle message delivery failures and retry logic?
- What happens when regulatory requirements change for a specific jurisdiction?
- How does the system prevent duplicate messages when a client is in multiple campaign segments?
