**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Epic 1 from Project Equinox Requirements - Multi-Channel Client Engagement Platform"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-27

- Q: Which CRM system(s) should the platform integrate with for lead handoff? → A: Generic API/webhook approach - Provide standardized integration that works with any CRM (Salesforce, HubSpot, custom systems)
- Q: What is the expected device fleet size per Portfolio Manager or for the entire platform? → A: Shared pool of 1500-2000 devices when fully operational
- Q: How should the system handle failed message deliveries? → A: Retry 3 times with exponential backoff (1min, 5min, 15min), then mark as failed and notify Portfolio Manager
- Q: What lead score threshold triggers automatic CRM handoff and Portfolio Manager notification? → A: Configurable per Portfolio Manager - Each PM sets their own threshold between 50-90
- Q: What happens when compliance monitoring detects a potential violation before sending? → A: Send with warning - Allow sending but flag violation for post-send compliance review

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Unified Communication Infrastructure (Priority: P1)

Portfolio Managers (PMs) need to reach prospective clients across multiple messaging platforms (WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, iMessage) from a centralized management interface. This eliminates the need to switch between different apps and physical mobile devices while managing outreach campaigns.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational capability for all client engagement activities. Without multi-channel communication infrastructure, Portfolio Managers cannot effectively reach clients on their preferred platforms, resulting in lost opportunities and inefficient workflows.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having a Portfolio Manager send test messages through the centralized dashboard to test accounts on each supported platform (WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, iMessage) and verify delivery and tracking.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Portfolio Manager logs into the MCEP dashboard, **When** they create a new outreach message, **Then** they can select target recipients across multiple messaging platforms from a single interface
2. **Given** a Portfolio Manager has sent messages to clients on different platforms, **When** they view the engagement analytics dashboard, **Then** they see response rates, open rates, and engagement metrics aggregated across all platforms
3. **Given** the system manages a shared pool of 1,500-2,000 mobile devices, **When** a device becomes unavailable, **Then** messages are automatically routed to alternative devices without manual intervention
4. **Given** a Portfolio Manager reviews campaign performance, **When** they access the analytics dashboard, **Then** they see real-time engagement metrics including delivery confirmation, read receipts, and response patterns

### User Story 2 - Market Segment Personalization (Priority: P2)

Portfolio Managers need to maintain multiple professional profiles tailored to different market segments, asset classes, and regional markets. Each profile includes customized messaging, visual branding, and language localization appropriate for the target audience.

**Why this priority**: While multi-channel infrastructure (P1) enables reaching clients, personalization significantly improves engagement rates. However, basic communication can function without personalization, making this a P2 priority.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by creating 3-5 test profiles for different market segments (e.g., cryptocurrency investors, real estate investors, different regions), configuring their localization and messaging, and verifying that outreach campaigns use the appropriate profile based on recipient segmentation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Portfolio Manager manages clients in different regions, **When** they create a new engagement profile, **Then** they can configure language preferences, cultural messaging guidelines, and regional compliance requirements
2. **Given** a Portfolio Manager has created 50 profiles for different segments, **When** they launch a campaign, **Then** the system automatically selects the appropriate profile based on recipient demographics and asset class interest
3. **Given** a Portfolio Manager wants to optimize engagement, **When** they configure A/B testing parameters, **Then** the system automatically tests different messaging approaches and identifies the highest-performing variations
4. **Given** the compliance team reviews engagement activities, **When** they audit profile configurations, **Then** they can verify that all profiles comply with platform terms of service and regional regulations

### User Story 3 - Intelligent Lead Management (Priority: P3)

Portfolio Managers need automated workflow orchestration to qualify leads, prioritize high-value prospects, and manage initial engagement sequences. The system uses machine learning to score leads based on engagement patterns and seamlessly hands off qualified prospects to human advisors.

**Why this priority**: Automation improves efficiency but requires the foundational infrastructure (P1) and personalization capabilities (P2) to be effective. This represents an optimization of an already-functional system.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by configuring lead scoring rules, running test campaigns with simulated prospect interactions, and verifying that leads are correctly scored, prioritized, and handed off to CRM systems when they meet qualification criteria.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new prospect engages with outreach content, **When** the system analyzes their interaction patterns, **Then** it automatically assigns a lead score based on engagement frequency, response quality, and asset class interest
2. **Given** a lead reaches the Portfolio Manager's configured qualification threshold (50-90 score range), **When** the automated engagement sequence completes, **Then** the system creates a CRM record and notifies the appropriate Portfolio Manager for personal follow-up
3. **Given** the compliance team monitors automated communications, **When** the system detects potential compliance violations, **Then** messages are sent with warnings and flagged for post-send compliance review with complete audit trails
4. **Given** Portfolio Managers review campaign effectiveness, **When** they analyze lead conversion metrics, **Then** they see response rate optimization trends showing continuous improvement from machine learning adjustments

### Edge Cases

- **Platform outage** (e.g., WhatsApp unavailable): System marks platform as degraded, queues messages for retry when platform recovers, notifies PM of delay; alternative platform used if prospect has multiple contact methods
- **Client blocks or reports spam**: Device/profile flagged for review, prospect removed from active campaigns on that platform, compliance team investigates; if spam rate exceeds threshold (0.1%), profile suspended pending review
- **Device limit reached for platform**: Device pool management automatically allocates additional devices from shared pool; if pool exhausted, campaigns queued until capacity available with PM notification
- **Message delivery failures**: System retries 3 times with exponential backoff (1min, 5min, 15min) plus jitter, then marks as failed and notifies Portfolio Manager (FR-016)
- **Regulatory requirement changes**: Phase 1: Manual compliance team updates flagging rules; Phase 2: External compliance system pushes rule updates via API, messages held pending rule application
- **Duplicate messages** (client in multiple segments): Deduplication at message router level using (prospect_id, campaign_id, 24h window) unique constraint; if prospect qualifies for multiple campaigns, PM receives notification to manually prioritize

- **Machine Learning Approach**: Specific ML algorithm selection (gradient boosting, neural networks, etc.) deferred to implementation phase; spec defines functional requirements (0-100 scoring, real-time updates, explainability) while maintaining technology agnosticism

### Implementation Phases

- **Phase 1 (Current Scope)**: Core messaging infrastructure with basic compliance monitoring that flags potential violations for manual review; provides audit trails and warning system
- **Phase 2 (Future)**: Integration with comprehensive multi-jurisdictional compliance system designed by external security consultant; automated compliance enforcement based on jurisdiction-specific rules

### Key Assumptions

- Phase 1 compliance approach (send-with-warning) is acceptable for testing and initial deployment with manual compliance review team oversight
- External security consultant will deliver multi-jurisdictional compliance framework design compatible with MCEP architecture
- Compliance review team has capacity to manually review flagged messages during Phase 1 operations
- Phase 2 compliance system integration will not require major architectural changes to core MCEP functionality
- Device fleet will scale from initial deployment to 1,500-2,000 devices at full operational capacity (Phase 2); Phase 1 requires minimum viable device pool for testing
