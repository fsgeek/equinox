Tasks are organized by user story priority (P1 → P2 → P3) following the dependency chain defined in plan.md. Each task includes:
- **TaskID**: Unique identifier for tracking
- **Priority**: P1 (critical), P2 (important), P3 (enhancement)
- **Story**: User story reference (US1, US2, US3)
- **File Path**: Primary implementation location
- **Dependencies**: Tasks that must complete first

## Dependency Graph

```
Setup Tasks → Foundational Infrastructure → US1 (P1) → US2 (P2) → US3 (P3) → Polish
                                              ↓
                                         Analytics (parallel)
```

**Story Completion Order**:
