# Feature Specification: Project Equinox - Global Alternative Asset Engagement Platform

## Overview

Equinox Asset Management, a rapidly growing, globally-distributed private investment firm, is launching a major initiative to expand its client base into new alternative asset classes, including specialized cryptocurrency funds and digital collectibles. Their current client engagement model is manual, lacks scalability, and cannot provide the security and discretion required by their target clientele.

This specification defines the complete cloud-native infrastructure for **Project Equinox** - the firm's central nervous system enabling a large, globally-distributed team of Portfolio Managers to identify, cultivate, and manage relationships with tens of thousands of clients simultaneously. The platform must be engineered for extreme scale, high security, and global performance.
