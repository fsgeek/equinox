# Feature Specification: Private Wealth Portal (PWP)

**Feature Branch**: `002-pwp-portal`
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Epic 2 from Project Equinox Requirements - Private Wealth Portal"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Secure Client Communications (Priority: P1)

High-net-worth clients require bank-grade encrypted communications with their Portfolio Managers for discussing sensitive financial matters. The portal provides end-to-end encrypted messaging, voice, and video capabilities with multi-factor authentication and biometric access controls.

**Why this priority**: Security and privacy are fundamental requirements for any wealth management platform. Without secure communications, clients will not trust the platform with sensitive financial discussions, making this capability essential for the portal to function.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating test client and Portfolio Manager accounts, initiating encrypted messaging/voice/video sessions, verifying end-to-end encryption is active, testing multi-factor authentication flows, and confirming secure document sharing and digital signatures work correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a high-net-worth client logs into the portal, **When** they initiate a message to their Portfolio Manager, **Then** the communication is automatically encrypted end-to-end and displays a verified encryption indicator
2. **Given** a client needs to share tax documents, **When** they upload files to the secure portal, **Then** documents are encrypted at rest and only accessible to authorized parties with full audit logging
3. **Given** a client accesses the portal from a new device, **When** they complete login, **Then** multi-factor authentication is required with support for biometric verification (fingerprint, face recognition)
4. **Given** a Portfolio Manager reviews communication history, **When** they access the audit log, **Then** they see a complete timestamped record of all communications, file access, and authentication events
5. **Given** clients require legally binding agreements, **When** they use the digital signature feature, **Then** signatures are cryptographically secure and meet regulatory compliance standards

### User Story 2 - Investment Analysis & Modeling (Priority: P2)

Portfolio Managers need sophisticated visualization and scenario modeling tools to demonstrate investment strategies, show historical performance, and illustrate potential outcomes. The portal provides interactive dashboards, what-if analysis, Monte Carlo simulations, and a sandbox environment for client demonstrations.

**Why this priority**: While secure communications (P1) enable client interactions, investment analysis tools significantly enhance the value proposition and support informed decision-making. However, basic portfolio viewing can function without advanced modeling, making this P2.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by creating sample portfolios with historical data, generating interactive performance visualizations, running what-if scenarios with different parameters, executing Monte Carlo simulations, and verifying that sandbox mode provides realistic test data for client demonstrations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a client reviews their portfolio, **When** they access the performance dashboard, **Then** they see interactive visualizations showing asset allocation, historical returns, and performance metrics compared to benchmarks
2. **Given** a Portfolio Manager demonstrates a strategy, **When** they use what-if modeling, **Then** clients can adjust investment parameters (allocation percentages, time horizons, risk levels) and immediately see projected outcomes
3. **Given** a client wants to understand risk exposure, **When** the Portfolio Manager runs a Monte Carlo simulation, **Then** the system generates probability distributions showing potential outcomes across thousands of scenarios
4. **Given** a Portfolio Manager needs to prepare a client presentation, **When** they use sandbox mode, **Then** they can demonstrate features using realistic test data without exposing actual client information
5. **Given** the product team wants to optimize user experience, **When** they implement A/B testing, **Then** they can measure which visualization approaches and interaction patterns lead to better client engagement

### User Story 3 - Global Performance Optimization (Priority: P3)

International clients require low-latency access from any global location with compliance for regional data residency requirements. The portal is deployed across multiple regions with intelligent content delivery and mobile-responsive design with offline capabilities.

**Why this priority**: Performance optimization improves user experience but is not essential for core functionality. Clients can still access the portal with higher latency, though the experience is degraded. This represents an enhancement to an already-functional system.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by deploying the portal to multiple regions (North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific), measuring latency from various global locations, verifying data residency compliance by checking where client data is stored, and testing mobile-responsive design on various devices with simulated offline scenarios.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a client travels internationally, **When** they access the portal from different regions, **Then** requests are automatically routed to the nearest geographic endpoint with sub-200ms latency
2. **Given** a client has limited internet connectivity, **When** they use the mobile app, **Then** they can access cached portfolio data offline and synchronize when connectivity is restored
3. **Given** regulatory requirements mandate data residency, **When** a European client's data is stored, **Then** it remains within EU data centers and complies with GDPR requirements
4. **Given** a client accesses the portal on various devices, **When** they navigate the interface, **Then** the design responsively adapts to screen sizes ranging from mobile phones to desktop monitors
5. **Given** content delivery uses CDN optimization, **When** clients load dashboards with charts and visualizations, **Then** assets are served from edge locations with optimal compression and caching

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a client loses their multi-factor authentication device?
- How does the system handle expired encryption certificates?
- What happens when a Monte Carlo simulation requires excessive computation time?
- How does the system manage data residency when a client moves between jurisdictions?
- What happens when offline mobile data conflicts with server updates?
- How does the system handle voice/video calls when network quality degrades?
- What happens when a digital signature needs to be revoked or invalidated?
