# Project Equinox Development Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Security-First Development

All code must prioritize security at every layer:
- Encryption required for all sensitive data (at rest and in transit)
- Zero-trust architecture: verify all access, trust nothing by default
- Secrets never committed to version control
- Security review mandatory for authentication, authorization, and cryptographic code
- Vulnerability patching SLA: Critical (24h), High (7 days), Medium (30 days)

### II. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Quality is built in, not bolted on:
- Minimum 80% unit test coverage for business logic
- Integration tests for all API endpoints
- Tests must be written before or alongside implementation
- All tests must pass before merge to main branch
- Flaky tests are treated as critical bugs

### III. API-First Design

Services communicate through well-defined contracts:
- OpenAPI (Swagger) specifications for all REST APIs
- Contract versioning to support backwards compatibility
- Consumer-driven contract tests at service boundaries
- Breaking changes require major version increment
- Comprehensive API documentation with request/response examples

### IV. Cloud-Native Architecture

Build for the cloud from day one:
- Services must be stateless and horizontally scalable
- Multi-region deployment for high availability
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for all resources
- Microservices architecture with clear bounded contexts
- Event-driven communication where appropriate

### V. Observability & Monitoring

If you can't measure it, you can't improve it:
- Structured logging for all services (JSON format)
- Distributed tracing for request flows across services
- Metrics collection for all KPIs (latency, throughput, errors)
- Actionable alerts with documented runbooks
- Dashboards for real-time system health

## Performance & Scalability Standards

### Response Time Targets
- API p95 latency: < 200ms
- API p99 latency: < 500ms
- Database query time: < 100ms for indexed lookups
- Background job execution: must not block user operations

### Scale Requirements
- System must support 1,500 concurrent users (Portfolio Managers)
- Handle 75,000+ managed entities (Manager Personas)
- Support 250,000+ client relationships
- Process thousands of concurrent automated workflows

### Resource Efficiency
- Optimize for minimal cloud infrastructure costs
- Implement connection pooling for all database access
- Use appropriate caching strategies (Redis, CDN)
- Right-size compute resources based on actual usage

## Development Workflow

### Version Control
- Git for all source code
- Feature branches for all development work
- Descriptive commit messages referencing work items
- Pull requests required for all changes to main

### Code Review Requirements
- Minimum one reviewer approval required
- Reviews must verify:
  - Adherence to constitution principles
  - Security implications
  - Performance implications
  - Test coverage and quality
  - API contract compliance

### Continuous Integration
- Automated builds on every commit
- All tests must pass (unit, integration, contract)
- Static analysis tools must pass
- Dependency security scanning required
- No merge to main unless CI passes

### Continuous Deployment
- Automated deployment to staging environment
- Manual approval gate for production deployment
- Blue-green or canary deployment strategies
- Automated rollback capability
- Post-deployment smoke tests required

## Data Protection & Privacy

### Encryption Standards
- AES-256 for data at rest
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- Hardware Security Modules (HSM) for private key storage
- Encryption key rotation policies enforced

### Access Control
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for all administrative functions
- Principle of least privilege
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for privileged access
- Audit logging for all administrative actions

### Data Minimization
- Collect only data necessary for functionality
- Implement data retention policies
- Secure deletion procedures for end-of-life data
- Regular data access audits

## Compliance & Governance

### Regulatory Compliance
- Code must comply with applicable financial regulations
- Data residency requirements must be respected per jurisdiction
- Privacy requirements implemented correctly (GDPR, CCPA where applicable)
- Compliance validation integrated into CI/CD pipeline

### Audit Trail
- Immutable audit logs for all privileged operations
- Tamper-evident log storage
- Log retention policies aligned with compliance requirements
- Automated audit report generation capability

### Change Management
- All production changes follow documented change management process
- Risk assessment required for high-impact changes
- Rollback plan required before deployment
- Post-deployment verification mandatory

## Code Quality Standards

### Clean Code Principles
- Self-documenting code with clear naming
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) for functions and classes
- Maximum function length: 50 lines (excluding comments)
- Eliminate code duplication through appropriate abstraction
- Comprehensive documentation for all public APIs

### Technical Debt Management
- Technical debt must be tracked in backlog
- Each sprint allocates time for debt reduction
- No new features that introduce known anti-patterns
- Refactoring must be incremental and well-tested

## Documentation Requirements

### Code Documentation
- All public interfaces must include docstrings/JSDoc
- Complex algorithms require explanatory comments
- README files required for all repositories
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for major technical decisions

### Operational Documentation
- Runbooks for common operational procedures
- Troubleshooting guides for known issues
- Deployment procedures documented and tested
- Incident response playbooks

### API Documentation
- OpenAPI specs kept synchronized with implementation
- Request/response examples for all endpoints
- Error conditions documented with remediation steps
- Authentication and authorization flows explained

## Reliability & Fault Tolerance

### High Availability
- Target: 99.9% uptime (< 43 minutes downtime/month)
- Multi-region deployment for disaster recovery
- Automated health checks and failover
- Database replication and backup strategies

### Graceful Degradation
- Services handle transient failures gracefully
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Circuit breakers for external dependencies
- Fallback mechanisms when dependencies unavailable

### Monitoring & Alerting
- Real-time monitoring of system health
- Proactive alerting before user impact
- On-call rotation with escalation procedures
- Post-incident reviews and remediation

## Principle Prioritization

When principles conflict, prioritize in this order:

1. **Security & Privacy** - Protect user data and system integrity
2. **Reliability & Availability** - Keep the system running
3. **Compliance & Governance** - Meet regulatory requirements
4. **Performance & Scalability** - Serve users efficiently
5. **Code Quality** - Maintain long-term maintainability
6. **Development Velocity** - Ship features quickly

## Governance

This constitution is the authoritative guide for all technical decisions.

- Constitution supersedes other documentation when conflicts arise
- All pull requests must demonstrate constitutional compliance
- Amendments require architecture review board approval
- Deviations require documented justification and approval

All team members are empowered and encouraged to raise concerns when these principles are not being followed.
